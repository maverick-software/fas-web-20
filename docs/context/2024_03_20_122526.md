# Contextual Understanding - System Analysis (2024-03-20 12:25:26)

## Project Overview
The Financial Analysis System v2.0 (FAS) is a full-stack web application designed for financial data visualization and analysis. The system is structured as a Python-based application with separate frontend and backend components.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. Frontend (Streamlit-based)
   - Located in `ai-data-tool/frontend/`
   - User interface for data upload and visualization

2. Backend (FastAPI)
   - Located in `ai-data-tool/backend/`
   - RESTful API for data processing and analysis

3. Automation Scripts
   - `run_application.bat` - Main application launcher
   - `run_backend.bat` - Backend server startup
   - `run_frontend.bat` - Frontend server startup
   - `setup.bat` - Environment setup script

## Project State

### Documentation Structure
- `/docs/` - Main documentation directory
  - `/context/` - System context and analysis
  - `/bugs/` - Issue tracking
  - `/console/logs/` - System logs
- Each directory maintains:
  - `__ai__.md` - Component documentation
  - `_change.logs` - Change tracking

### Known Issues
1. One documented bug in `docs/bugs/arrow_serialization_error/`
2. Project is in early development phase with many pending components

## Entry Points
1. Main Application: `ai-data-tool/run_application.bat`
2. Backend Server: `ai-data-tool/run_backend.bat`
3. Frontend Server: `ai-data-tool/run_frontend.bat`

## Next Steps
1. Review and resolve the arrow serialization error
2. Complete implementation of pending components from previous context
3. Establish proper logging system
4. Implement comprehensive testing framework
5. Set up proper error handling across all components

## Notes
- System follows documentation protocols from `.cursor/rules/`
- Project is well-structured but in early development phase
- Multiple batch scripts available for different deployment scenarios
