# Arrow Serialization Error Investigation Questions

## Context Questions
- [x] When does this error occur? (During data loading, processing, or display?)
  - Answer: During DataFrame display in Streamlit when converting to Arrow format
- [x] What type of data is being processed when the error occurs?
  - Answer: Mixed data types (bytes and float) in the DataFrame
- [x] Which component of the system is triggering this error? (Frontend/Backend)
  - Answer: Frontend (Streamlit) during DataFrame display
- [x] Is this happening with all data or specific datasets?
  - Answer: Specific datasets with mixed data types and unnamed columns

## Technical Questions
- [x] What is the structure of the DataFrame before serialization?
  - Answer: Contains mixed data types and unnamed columns
- [x] Why is there an "Unnamed: 1" column in the DataFrame?
  - Answer: Created during CSV/Excel file loading when there are unnamed columns
- [x] What data types are present in the problematic column?
  - Answer: Mix of bytes and float objects
- [x] Are there any data type conversion issues in the pipeline?
  - Answer: Yes, inconsistent data types in object columns

## Solution Questions
- [x] How can we properly handle mixed data types in the DataFrame?
  - Answer: Convert mixed-type columns to string type before display
- [x] Should we implement data type validation before Arrow conversion?
  - Answer: Yes, added type checking and conversion
- [x] Do we need to modify the data preprocessing pipeline?
  - Answer: Yes, added cleaning steps for unnamed columns
- [x] Is there a need to update the Streamlit configuration?
  - Answer: No, issue was with data handling, not configuration

## Verification Questions
- [ ] How can we verify the fix works with different data types?
  - Answer: Test with various file formats and data types
- [ ] What test cases should we create to prevent future issues?
  - Answer: Create test files with mixed data types and unnamed columns
- [ ] Are there any performance implications of the fix?
  - Answer: Minimal impact, only affects data display preparation
