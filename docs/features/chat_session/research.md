# Chat Session Feature Research

## Codebase Analysis
- **Project Type:** Financial Analysis System v2.0
- **Architecture:** Dual-component system (FastAPI + Streamlit)
- **Current State:** System has established data processing and visualization capabilities

## Relevant Components
1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**
   - Main entry: `frontend/app.py`
   - Component structure in `frontend/components/`
   - Existing UI components for data interaction

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   - Main entry: `backend/app/main.py`
   - Router structure in `backend/app/routers/`
   - Data processing capabilities in `backend/src/data/`

## External Research
1. **Best Practices**
   - Session management in FastAPI
   - WebSocket integration for real-time communication
   - State management in Streamlit applications

2. **Similar Implementations**
   - FastAPI Chat Examples
   - Streamlit Session State Management
   - Real-time Data Updates in Financial Systems

## Technical Considerations
1. **Session Management**
   - User session tracking
   - Data persistence between interactions
   - State synchronization between frontend and backend

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Real-time response capabilities
   - Memory management for chat history
   - Scalability considerations

3. **Security Aspects**
   - Session encryption
   - Data privacy
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Integration Points
1. **Frontend Integration**
   - UI components for chat interface
   - Real-time updates handling
   - State management with existing components

2. **Backend Integration**
   - API endpoints for chat functionality
   - Data processing pipeline integration
   - Event handling system

## Notes
- Must maintain existing performance standards
- Should integrate seamlessly with current data visualization features
- Need to consider impact on existing system resources
