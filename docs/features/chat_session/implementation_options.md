# Chat Session Implementation Options

## Option 1: WebSocket-Based Real-Time Chat (Recommended)

### Implementation Strategy
- Implement WebSocket connections using FastAPI's WebSocket support
- Create dedicated chat components in Streamlit frontend
- Use Redis for temporary message storage and session management

### Pros
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Efficient resource usage
- Scalable architecture
- Native support in FastAPI

### Cons
- Additional complexity in setup
- Requires Redis setup and management
- More complex error handling

### Feasibility: HIGH
- FastAPI has built-in WebSocket support
- Streamlit can handle real-time updates
- Clear implementation path with existing tools

## Option 2: REST-Based Polling Solution

### Implementation Strategy
- Implement REST endpoints for message sending/receiving
- Use polling mechanism in Streamlit frontend
- Store chat history in existing database

### Pros
- Simpler implementation
- Uses existing infrastructure
- Easier to debug and maintain

### Cons
- Higher latency
- More server load due to polling
- Less efficient resource usage

### Feasibility: MEDIUM
- Easy to implement
- May not meet performance requirements
- Could strain server resources

## Option 3: Server-Sent Events (SSE) Implementation

### Implementation Strategy
- Implement SSE endpoints in FastAPI
- Create event listeners in Streamlit
- Use existing database for message persistence

### Pros
- One-way real-time updates
- Simpler than WebSockets
- Good browser support

### Cons
- Limited to server-to-client communication
- Requires careful connection management
- May need additional client-side complexity

### Feasibility: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Good balance of features and complexity
- May require additional error handling
- Limited by one-way communication

## Recommendation
Option 1 (WebSocket-Based) is recommended because:
1. Best performance characteristics
2. True real-time capabilities
3. Most scalable solution
4. Best user experience
5. Matches system's performance requirements
