# Tech Stack Document

This document outlines the technologies chosen for our AI-Powered Real-Time Data Visualization & Manipulation Tool. Each component is selected to make the application user-friendly, scalable, and efficient, especially for non-technical users like financial analysts and business professionals. Below, we explain the rationale behind each technology choice in everyday language.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is all about the look and feel of the application. We strive to provide a clean, minimalist design that works seamlessly in modern web browsers with dark mode support. Here's what we use:

*   **Streamlit**

    *   A powerful tool for rapid prototyping that helps us build an intuitive web-based interface quickly.
    *   Provides built-in components like file upload areas, interactive charts, command input boxes, and dynamic tables.

*   **Plotly**

    *   Enables interactive, real-time charts such as bar graphs, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
    *   Supports detailed interactions like zooming, panning, and hover tooltips, which help users understand their data better.

*   **Matplotlib**

    *   Useful for generating static chart exports (PNG/PDF) when needed, providing traditional visualization options alongside interactive ones.

These technologies ensure that users can see immediate visual feedback on their data manipulations with a friendly and responsive interface.

## Backend Technologies

Behind the scenes, the backend handles all the data processing and logic, making sure the app runs smoothly and quickly. Our choices include:

*   **FastAPI**

    *   A modern, high-performance web framework that supports asynchronous operations. This means the server can handle multiple tasks at once, keeping the app responsive.
    *   Ideal for setting up API endpoints for uploading files, processing natural language commands, and returning updated datasets and visualizations.

*   **Pandas & NumPy**

    *   These libraries work together to streamline data import, cleaning, and transformation. They convert uploaded CSV/XLSX files into structured formats, while handling operations like filtering, sorting, and aggregation effectively.

*   **OpenAI API**

    *   Powers the AI engine that interprets natural language commands. Users can type phrases like "Filter entries below $1000" or "Create a new column for total revenue," and the AI processes these commands into data operations.

*   **CassandraDB**

    *   Our choice for a robust, scalable database that can handle large volumes of data efficiently. CassandraDB supports rapid data access and is designed to work well with unstructured JSON-like data, making it ideal for our evolving dataset storage needs.

These backend technologies work together to process user commands quickly and accurately, ensuring that the system responds in near real-time.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

For deployment and maintaining the project's ongoing reliability, we have planned a setup that is both robust and flexible:

*   **Local Web Server Deployment**

    *   Initially, the application will run locally, which simplifies setup and testing. Users simply access the tool via their web browser without complex login requirements.

*   **Version Control Systems (e.g., Git)**

    *   Code is managed through version control systems to maintain history, track changes, and support collaborative development.

*   **CI/CD Pipelines**

    *   Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment processes (using platforms like GitHub Actions) help automate testing and deployment. This means every update is checked for reliability before it goes live.

*   **Future Cloud Hosting**

    *   Although we’re starting with a local deployment, the architecture is designed to move to a cloud platform if we need to scale or support multi-user scenarios later on.

This infrastructure ensures reliable performance and makes it easy to update or scale the application as needed.

## Third-Party Integrations

To boost functionality while keeping development streamlined, several third-party services are integrated into the tool:

*   **OpenAI API**

    *   Provides the natural language processing power needed to interpret user commands into data operations.

*   **CassandraDB**

    *   Supports high-speed, flexible data storage and scales as data volume grows.

*   **Plotly & Matplotlib Libraries**

    *   Enhance visualization capabilities by producing both interactive charts and static images for reports and exports.

These integrations bring tried-and-tested solutions into our application, allowing us to focus on delivering a smooth user experience.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Although the current deployment focuses on local usage without complex login security, careful thought has been given to security and performance:

*   **Security Measures**

    *   While we’re bypassing detailed user authentication for now (by running it locally), the architecture supports future implementations of OAuth 2.0 or SSO if needed.
    *   Data privacy will be maintained with encryption protocols when transitioning to cloud infrastructure.

*   **Performance Optimizations**

    *   Our goal is rapid response times: natural language commands are processed in under 2 seconds, and visualizations update in under 1 second.
    *   Efficient libraries like FastAPI, Pandas, and NumPy ensure that even large datasets (with plans to support millions of rows) are handled smoothly.
    *   Minimalist and highlighted error messages and feedback panels help users quickly understand any issues and take corrective actions.

These measures ensure that the tool remains secure and high-performing, providing users with a trustworthy and efficient experience.
